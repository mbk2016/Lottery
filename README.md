# Lottery
An application simulating a lottery.

For now the coupon contains 6 unique numbers in range 1-49. (might be a subject for user to decide, todo later)
The user should be able to choose numbers for his coupon (todo, for now it's coded in by-hand.)
The program adds a declared number of random coupons to a list and checks whether user's coupon is in the list == win.
